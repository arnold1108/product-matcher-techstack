## Project Background
The e-commerce industry is continuously evolving, with a vast amount of user activity data being generated in real-time. To provide a personalized and engaging shopping experience, it is crucial for e-commerce businesses to efficiently process and analyze this data. Moreover, recommending relevant products to users based on their preferences and behavior has become a critical aspect of increasing customer satisfaction and driving sales.

This project aims to address these challenges by developing a comprehensive end-to-end data pipeline and recommender engine specifically tailored for e-commerce. The pipeline enables seamless ingestion, processing, and storage of streaming user activity events, while the recommender engine utilizes this data to generate personalized recommendations.

By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as streaming platforms, distributed computing frameworks, and machine learning algorithms, we can extract valuable insights from the user activity data in real-time. The data pipeline ensures the efficient processing and transformation of these events, enabling us to persist the enriched data in a highly scalable and reliable database.

The heart of the project lies in the recommender engine, which utilizes state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms and machine learning techniques. By analyzing user behavior, preferences, and product information, the engine generates highly accurate and personalized product recommendations. This empowers e-commerce businesses to deliver tailored shopping experiences, enhance customer satisfaction, and increase conversion rates.
